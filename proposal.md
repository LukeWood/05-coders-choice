## Proposed Project

I plan on creating a mini-casino simulator that includes some of the more popular gambling games, such as Poker, Blackjack, and Roulette. The interface would involve a user choosing between those three (or more) options and then simply playing against the computer. Alongside this functionality, it should also tell you the probability of winning the hand depending on what you choose, and a check afterwards that makes sure if that's the move you want to do. This project will be to illustrate how unfair most gambling games are, and will not have bluffing as a part of the game.
## Outline Structure

My project will first of all have a human interface for the player to interact with the "casino". Then, there will be two modules: one in charge of the deck/numbers and the other for calculating all the percentages involved in the player's decision. Lastly, there will be a supervised server in charge of all the decisions involved in this process.
