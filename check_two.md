For my second check, I built a lot more of the functionality of the Blackjack module and I started planning out my Roulette module also. The Blackjack one is almost done save for the conclusion and automatic restart of the game but that should be done fairly soon. The transition between Roulette and Blackjack happens very smoothly in-game, and I've added a bunch of error correction in order to try and make the experience as nice as possible.

PS. This was not added for the official check two turn-in but I am including it with my final submission just for record keeping sake.
